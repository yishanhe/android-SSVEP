android-SSVEP
=============

This is a basic ssvep supporting project, which just plots several boxs and make them flickering.
Current implementation may be problematic since we simply used the view and animation. 
However, our experiments work using this scheme.


Future work could be 

1. a re-implmentation using OPENGL ES.
2. generate layout in a programmatical way. currently you need manually modify the layout file to place boxes.
